**Roadmap**

**1. Blockchain Basics**
- Blockchain Concept: Learn how blocks, chains, and consensus work. If you understand what a
hash is, that's enough-no need to go too deep into hashing algorithms.
- Public/Private Key Cryptography: This is important. Focus on learning ECDSA, as it's the most
used in Ethereum. RSA is good to know too.
- Digital Signatures and Cryptographic Proofs: Get a basic understanding of Merkle Trees and
Zero-Knowledge Proofs. No need to go into too much detail.

**2. Smart Contracts**
- Learn Solidity: Solidity is the main language for smart contracts on Ethereum, so it's key to master
it.
- Development Environments: Start with Remix because it's the easiest. After that, try Hardhat or
Foundry for more advanced projects.
- Interacting with Smart Contracts: Use ethers.js as your main tool for interacting with the blockchain
from the frontend. Web3.js is less important nowadays.

**3. Blockchain Networks**
- Ethereum: This is the main platform for smart contracts, so make sure to understand how it works.
- Private Solutions like Hyperledger: Don't worry about this-most blockchain developers don't need
to focus on it.
- Proof of Stake and Networks like Polygon: Learn about Proof of Stake because it's important for
understanding scalability platforms like Polygon.

**4. DApps (Decentralized Applications)**
- Fullstack Blockchain Development: Learn how to connect your DApps with smart contracts using
ethers.js. You don't need to use Web3.js.
- MetaMask: Understand how to use MetaMask well because it's the main tool for users to interact
with the blockchain.

**5. Scalability Solutions**
- Layer 2 Solutions (L2): Focus on the basics of Optimistic Rollups and ZK-Rollups since they are
the most important for Ethereum.
- Lightning Network: You can learn the basics, but it's not as relevant for Ethereum.
  
**6. Testing Smart Contracts**
- Ethers.js: This is the most important tool for interacting with smart contracts.
- Mocha and Chai: These are testing frameworks, but focus more on ethers.js for testing smart
contracts.

**7. RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**
- Learn how the RPC protocol works for sending transactions to the blockchain. It's like HTTP and is
essential to understand how nodes interact with the network.

**8. Practical Projects**
- Build an ERC-20 or ERC-721 Token: Learn how to create a token on Ethereum and build a
practical project with it.
- Create a Full DApp: Combine smart contracts with a frontend and connect them to the blockchain
using MetaMask and ethers.js.

**9. Security and Auditing**
- If you want to be a programmer, don't spend too much time on auditing. It's enough to know the
common vulnerabilities like reentrancy and overflow, but you don't need to learn audit tools like
MythX or Slither unless you want to focus on security.

**10. DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**
- Learn the basics of DeFi and try out platforms like Uniswap or Aave to understand the most
common use cases.
